# What-and-Where-are-the-World's-Oldest-Businesses

## Project Description

This project will take you through the process of analyzing data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses. You'll learn how to merge datasets, manipulate and filter data, and use grouping techniques to answer questions about the world's oldest businesses. You'll work with data on the founding year and industry of businesses from around the world, and use these data to explore questions such as: which industries have the most oldest businesses, which continents have the most oldest businesses, and what are the oldest businesses in each industry and continent. Through this project, you'll develop your skills in data manipulation, merging, and analysis, and gain insights into the world's longest-lasting businesses.

# Project Tasks

## **1. The oldest business in the world**

This question aims to identify the oldest business in the world by analyzing a dataset that includes the year of foundation of various businesses across different industries and countries. The project will require merging datasets, filtering, and sorting the data to determine the oldest business and its characteristics.

## **2. How many businesses were founded before 1000?**

This question seeks to determine the number of businesses in the dataset that were founded before the year 1000. It is a straightforward count query that will help provide insight into the historical context of the oldest businesses in the world.

## **3. Which businesses were founded before 1000?**

This question is about identifying businesses that were founded before the year 1000. To answer this question, we will need to use a dataset containing information about the founding dates of businesses, and then filter that dataset to include only those businesses founded before the year 1000. We can then display a list of these businesses or use further analysis to explore patterns and characteristics of these ancient enterprises.

## **4. Exploring the categories**

In this question, we will explore the industry categories of the world's oldest businesses. We will use merging and grouping techniques to identify the different categories and the number of businesses in each category. This will give us insights into the types of businesses that have been able to survive for centuries and the industries that are able to adapt to changing market conditions.

## **5. Counting the categories**

This question is about counting the number of oldest businesses in each industry category. The goal is to explore the dataset to determine which categories have the most oldest businesses and which have the least. This information could be useful for business analysts, economists, and historians interested in studying the growth and evolution of industries over time. The result of this analysis will be a table showing each industry category and the number of oldest businesses in that category.

## **6. Oldest business by continent**

This question aims to identify the oldest businesses by continent. By merging and manipulating data from different datasets, we can determine the oldest businesses in each continent and their corresponding industry categories. This analysis will provide insight into the history of businesses in different parts of the world and how they have survived over time.

## **7. Joining everything for further analysis**

This question involves merging multiple datasets together to create a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. By combining data on businesses, categories, countries, and continents, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world's oldest businesses and how they are distributed across different industries and regions. This merging process will involve using techniques such as inner, left, and outer joins to combine data from multiple sources. The resulting dataset can then be used for further analysis and visualization.

## **8. Counting categories by continent**

This question involves analyzing the oldest businesses dataset to count the number of businesses in each industry category by continent. This analysis will provide insights into which industries have been most successful in different parts of the world over time. The dataset will need to be merged with information on the continents where each business is located, and then grouped by both continent and industry category to obtain the desired count. This analysis could be useful for businesses looking to expand into new regions or industries, as well as for researchers studying the history and development of global industries.

## **9. Filtering counts by continent and category**

This question aims to filter the counts of oldest businesses by continent and category to identify the specific continents and categories that have the most or least number of oldest businesses. By filtering the counts, we can gain insights into the historical business trends of different regions and industries, which can be useful for future business planning and decision-making.
